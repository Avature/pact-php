# Example Pacts

The json files in this folder are explicitly here for an easy-to-read output of the test examples. These are *not* the actual test results from running all these tests of this project. By default, the pact files of this project's examples are written to example/output.  The tests themselves need to generate the appropropriate files as part of the tests.

To run the tests locally, try `composer test`
